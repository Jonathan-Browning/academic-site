Increasing student innovation and improving economic growth directly aligns with the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals 8 and 9. This can be achieved through entrepreneurship teaching to computer science students. There is clear evidence that the number of startup ventures created by students and graduates outweighs those created by faculty members. Most startup ventures require software (i.e., a smartphone application or website) to be developed, hence computer science students are best placed to address this need. Yet the fundamental issue of idea generation persists, that is a barrier to students pursuing startup ventures. This project aims to use a software solution to gather data about companies in Northern Ireland, which can then be used by students following an evidence based approach to idea generation when creating a startup business. Furthermore, this novel teaching method could be used in computer science (and other degree backgrounds) entrepreneurship teaching globally, and the empirical data collected will facilitate further collaborations with business schools.
