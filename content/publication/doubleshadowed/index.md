abstract: In this paper, we provide an alternative characterization for format 1 of the recently proposed double shadowed Rician fading model. Unlike the original definition, both the dominant component and the rms signal are impacted by Nakagami-m processes. For this exposition, we derive analytical expressions for the envelope probability density function (PDF), the moments, the moment generating function, and the joint envelope-phase PDF. In addition, with the aid of the joint envelope-phase PDF, we investigate the phase properties of this interpretation of the double shadowed Rician fading model, while using the moments, we provide an analysis of the corresponding amount of fading.
